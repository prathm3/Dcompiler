## üöÄ Features

- **JVM Runner**: Dynamically runs Java Virtual Machine for code execution.
- **Code Compilation**: Efficiently compiles Java code on-the-fly using the `CodeExecutionService`.
- **Debugging Support**: Provides debugging capabilities for analyzing and troubleshooting code.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with Vert.x for reactive programming and Spring Boot for dependency injection and REST APIs.
- **API-Driven**: Exposes RESTful endpoints for compiling and debugging code.
- **Modular Design**: Decoupled services for better maintainability and scalability.
